## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Frontend build
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS+ language

### What I learned

I focused on reinforcing knowledge I already had. I always try to improve it and add new things; even if it’s not perfect yet, it helps me better understand how things work.

### Continued development

I tried to structure the notification information using the appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces. I still have a lot to learn and understand about how to do it in the best way.

### Useful resources

Talwind, React, TypeScript documentation.
